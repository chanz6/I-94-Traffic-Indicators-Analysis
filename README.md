# Finding Heavy Traffic Indicators on I-94

## Introduction
In this project, I'll be analyzing a dataset on westbound traffic on the I-94 Interstate highway. The goal is to identify key indicators of heavy traffic on the I-94, such as weather conditions, time of day, and day of the week. The dataset, which can be found in the ```Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv``` file, was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/492/metro+interstate+traffic+volume). All analysis code is contained in the ```I94.ipynb``` file.  

To achieve these findings, we use various analytical techniques in Python, leveraging libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Our approach involves examining summary statistics, histogram distributions, and time-based patterns to identify factors that significantly impact traffic volume.
